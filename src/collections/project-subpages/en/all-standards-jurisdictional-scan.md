## Theme 4: Developing standard and reaching consensus on the draft

### Description

The technical committee meets and begins to create the content for the standard document as defined by the scope (see Theme 3) producing  a first draft. The committee deliberates and comes to a consensus on what features and criteria should be included (or excluded) from the specifications.

### Research questions

- How is consensus achieved? How are objections handled?
- Is there guidance for effective, inclusive consensus making? 
- What is the chair’s role in consensus making?

### Summary

- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)2 has two types of decisions: Chair decision, which is made by the chair based on their own judgment, and Group decision, which is made by consensus or by vote. Consensus is achieved through deliberation of views and objections. The Process Document encourages each group to specify minimum thresholds of active support to prevent apathy in decision-making. The chair has flexibility in assessing consensus, and voting is used only when deliberation fails to reach unanimous consensus. Dissenters can either abstain or register  a formal objection with the W3C Team, which handles the objection and its decision. Additional processes related to formal objections include convening the W3C council, reviewing, and appealing decisions.
- The WHATWG1 process involves a Contributor and Workstream Participant Agreement for contributions to become part of the living standard. The sequence is  proposal, incubation, iteration, commitment, and standardization. Decision-making occurs through participation in the Workstream, editor decisions, and scope definition. Issues can be escalated to the Steering Group. Acceptance into the living standard is determined through asynchronous discussion and a triage meeting, with at least two implementers and no strong objections.
- The European Technical Standards Institute (ETSI)3 is a global organization that focuses on standardization, resourcing, and final approval. Consensus is general agreement, characterized by the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues. After approval, the documents are submitted to the ETSI Secretariat for publication. ETSI guides and standards are then made available to members for voting, with the success of the vote determining the standard's publication. For European standards, the secretariat makes the draft available to National Standards Organizations (NSOs), who conduct a public inquiry and consultation. If successful, the standard may be published. The Chair aims to reach consensus through discussion, considering the objectives of obtaining the largest consensus possible and resolving potential conflicts. Reaching consensus may take time due to different stakeholders and different knowledge domains. If consensus cannot be reached, a secret ballot may be held.
- The ISO4 Central Secretariat approves the Draft International Standard, allowing 12 weeks for members to comment and vote. A successful vote requires two-thirds of Technical Committee or Subcommittee members to vote in favor. The approval stage requires time for discussions, negotiation, and resolution of technical disagreements. ISO Directive, part 1, states that those expressing sustained opposition have a right to be heard. Leadership checks if the opposition is backed by an important group, recognizes it, and handles it honestly. The directive also outlines appeal procedures, including those against subcommittee and technical committee decisions.
- The development of standards in Japan,22,23 involves an initial proposal from stakeholders, followed by technical committees drafting specifications, guidelines, and requirements. Consensus is sought through discussions and deliberations, with members encouraged to express their views and provide feedback. If objections arise, they are addressed through further discussion and negotiation. The Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) provides guidelines on effective consensus-building, emphasizing transparency, inclusivity, and considering all viewpoints in decision-making. The chairperson plays a crucial role in facilitating discussions and guiding the consensus-building process, ensuring all members have an opportunity to contribute. The chair is responsible for addressing conflicts, mediating discussions, and adhering to established guidelines. Once consensus is reached, the chair helps finalize the draft for approval, ensuring it accurately reflects the committee's collective input.
- India's Bureau of Standards (BIS)30 is a key player in the development of standards. The process begins with identifying the need for a standard based on stakeholder input, market demands, and regulatory requirements. Technical committees are formed, including experts from various fields, to draft the standard. The draft is then circulated for public consultation, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback. Consensus building is achieved through discussions and negotiations among committee members, aiming to incorporate diverse perspectives. If objections arise, the committee engages in dialogue to address them. Formal voting may be conducted to resolve disagreements, and a majority vote can help move forward if consensus cannot be reached. BIS provides procedural guidelines emphasizing inclusivity and transparency in the consensus-building process. Training sessions and workshops are also conducted to improve communication skills and conflict resolution. The chair plays a crucial role in consensus making, guiding discussions, mediating conflicts, decision-making, and ensuring inclusivity.
- The South African24,25 Standards Development Process involves technical committees drafting standards based on identified needs, research, and stakeholder input. Public consultation allows stakeholders to provide feedback. The process involves extensive discussion, voting, and handling objections through open dialogue. The draft may be revised based on valid objections, and further rounds may be scheduled to ensure all voices are heard. The South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) provides guidelines on effective consensus-making, emphasizing inclusivity, transparency, and respect for diverse perspectives. Training resources may be offered to committee members on facilitation and consensus-building techniques. The chair plays a crucial role in guiding discussions, managing conflicts, maintaining focus, and summarizing and proposing solutions. The chair may summarize discussions, highlight areas of agreement, and propose pathways forward when consensus is difficult to achieve.
- China's 32,33,34 standardization process involves expert committees organized by the Standardization Administration of China (SAC) or relevant industry associations. These committees collaborate on technical needs, market demands, and regulatory requirements. Consensus is reached through discussions, revisions, and consultations among committee members, often involving multiple rounds of review. In China, consensus is a broad agreement among committee members, encouraging open dialogue and negotiation. Objections are addressed through discussions, and if consensus cannot be achieved, alternative solutions or compromises are explored. The SAC emphasizes inclusive participation and open communication in the standardization process. Training sessions may be offered to committee members on effective communication and negotiation strategies. The chair plays a crucial role in guiding the consensus process, managing discussions, ensuring all members have the opportunity to express their opinions, and facilitating conflict resolution.

## Theme 5: Public feedback on drafted standard

### Description

The draft standard is made available for public review and comment, and the SDO can try to engage and to encourage participation in order to ensure as wide a consensus from the public as possible regarding the standard in question.

### Research questions

- When are there public touchpoints in the process?
- How is public feedback gathered?
- How is the public informed?
- How transparent is the process?

### Summary

- ETSI's3 Standardization Principles of Transparency state that information on new standardization activities is publicly and widely announced through suitable and accessible means. Only European Standards (EN) standards go through a Public Enquiry stage, carried out by National Standards Organizations (NSOs). The process includes consultations that result in the submission of the national position. The transparency of the process, how information is announced, and how comments are gathered may differ between NSOs. For example, NBN in Belgium has a public portal for viewing and commenting on EN standards in development, while DIN in Germany allows readers to read and comment on standards on their website. Standards documents in development are available through a public portal in PDF format, and comments can be made through a short online form.
- Public consultations on drafted standards are conducted by national standards bodies (NSBs) and European36 standardization organizations like CEN and CENELEC. These consultations allow stakeholders and the general public to review and comment on the drafts before they are finalized. Draft standards are typically published on the NSB's or relevant organization's website, with key touchpoints being the initial draft release and a specified review period. Feedback is usually gathered through online platforms, workshops, and meetings. Organizations inform the public through official announcements, newsletters, and updates on their websites, as well as social media. They may also use existing networks of stakeholders to disseminate information about upcoming public consultations and the availability of draft standards. The process is generally transparent, with drafts readily available in an accessible format  to the public. Comments received during consultations are often summarized and published, providing insight into how stakeholder input is considered. Many organizations publish reports summarizing the feedback received and how it influenced the final standard.
- The Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC)23 conducts a process of public touchpoints in the development of standards. The draft review phase involves public review and comment, followed by a consultation period for stakeholders to review and submit feedback. Public meetings and discussions are organized to foster dialogue between the public, industry experts, and SDO representatives. Feedback can be gathered through online platforms, written submissions, workshops, and meetings. Official websites, newsletters, bulletins, and media outlets are used to inform the public about the draft standards. Transparency is maintained through the publication of feedback, rationale for decisions, and access to documents. After the consultation period ends, SDOs publish a summary of the feedback received, explaining how and why certain suggestions were incorporated or rejected in the final version of the standard. This detailed summary  adds a layer of transparency to the decision-making process.
- Standards Australia13 facilitates the process of developing standards in Australia, ensuring public participation and consensus. Drafts are made available for public comment for 9 weeks, and the technical committee takes all feedback. Public touchpoints include the draft review phase, consultation period, forums, and meetings. Feedback is gathered through online submissions, written submissions, and meetings. Standards Australia informs the public through its official website, email alerts, social media platforms, newsletters, and targeted outreach to industry groups, professional associations, and consumer organizations. Transparency is maintained through the publication of feedback, rationale for decisions, and access to documents. After the consultation period ends, a summary of the feedback received is made available on the SDO's website. SDOs provide explanations for how and why certain suggestions were incorporated or rejected in the final version of the standard, adding a layer of transparency to the decision-making process. Access to documents, including the draft standard, public feedback reports, and the final standard, allows stakeholders to follow the evolution of the standard from draft to final approval.
- The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)11 and industry-focused organizations like IEEE and ASTM International ensure public participation in the standards development process. The process involves several public touchpoints, including the Drafting Phase, Public Review Period, Open Meetings, Feedback Generation, and Public Stakeholder Meetings. Feedback is primarily collected through online portals, email and written submissions, workshops, forums, or webinars. SDOs also publish draft standards and announcements on their websites and dedicated portals like ANSI's Standards Action newsletter. They also send email alerts and newsletters to members and stakeholders, targeting specific industries or sectors to ensure relevant stakeholders are aware of upcoming draft standards. Broader public awareness is sometimes achieved through media outlets and social media, especially when standards have significant public interest or impact. Transparency is maintained through the publication of comments and decisions, the rationale for changes, and public access to documents. After the consultation period, SDOs typically publish a summary of the comments received and how they were addressed, with detailed responses provided to ensure transparency. If changes are made based on public feedback, SDOs often provide an explanation for the decisions made, usually shared in a report accompanying the final standard.
- Taiwan's14,15,16,17,18,19 standards development process involves public enquiry and standards harmonization to ensure alignment with international and regional frameworks.

Feedback is collected through online meetings, newsletters, and collaborations, and ABNT maintains transparency by publishing decision rationales.
- In Ireland12, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) manages the public consultation process through the Your Standards, Your Say platform, aiming to ensure broad participation and a consensus-based approach to standards development. The process begins after the NSAI's technical committees develop a draft standard, with a consultation period typically lasting 4 to 8 weeks. Stakeholders can review the draft and submit feedback through various channels, including an online platform, email and written submissions, workshops, webinars, or face-to-face meetings. NSAI also posts notifications about new draft standards on its website and consultation platform, sends email alerts to registered stakeholders, and uses traditional media channels and social media platforms to inform the broader public. For technical standards affecting specific sectors, NSAI may contact industry groups, professional associations, and other key stakeholders directly to encourage their participation. Transparency is maintained through the publication of feedback, the rationale for changes, and public access to final standards. The final version of the standard and the accompanying report outlines how feedback was addressed. NSAI demonstrates transparency by clearly documenting all stages of the public consultation and publishing detailed explanations for any changes made to the draft standard based on the public's feedback. For example, when NSAI was revising standards related to energy efficiency in buildings, the draft was made available on the Your Standards, Your Say platform.
- The Standardization Administration of China (SAC)32,33,34 and other Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) in China manage the public consultation process for standards. Public participation is encouraged to ensure a broad consensus, with transparency levels varying compared to some Western countries. The process involves several touchpoints, including the draft review stage, public consultation period, industry and stakeholder engagement, and feedback collection. SDOs collect feedback through online platforms, written submissions, workshops, and public meetings. Draft standards are published on SAC's official website and the National Public Service Platform for Standards Information, and notifications are disseminated through newsletters, targeted outreach, social media, and official news outlets. SDOs often collaborate with industry associations to spread awareness and encourage participation. Transparency in the process is limited, with SAC publishing the final standards but not providing detailed responses to individual comments or a summary of feedback. The rationale behind decisions may not be as detailed as in other countries.
- In Russia35, drafted standards are made available for public review and comment through Rosstandart, the Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and Metrology. The process lasts for at least 60 days, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback. Public consultations are crucial in the standardization process, involving industry experts, businesses, and the general public. Once prepared, the draft is published through official channels and industry-specific portals. Feedback is collected through Rosstandart's website and industry-specific channels, ensuring input from technical experts and broader public opinions. After the comment period, the technical committee reviews the feedback, integrating it into the draft and making necessary revisions. The transparency of the standard development process is maintained, but the level of public engagement can vary based on platform accessibility and communication.
- The W3C2 website allows users to search for draft standards, with the "any reports in progress" filter showing only working drafts. Public review announcements are posted to the W3 Public Review Announce mailing list. W3C has a web page describing how the public can participate in reviews and feedback, including reviewing drafts, implementing drafts, reporting bugs, commenting on draft charters, developing tests, and evaluating implementations of draft standards. Technical documents are open for feedback when a Working Draft is published by a Working Group, and comments are gathered via the Working Group's github issue tracker. W3C maintains open and public mailing lists, a history of revisions and drafts, and Github repositories tracking contributions and discussions on issues related to working groups. The News section on the website shares details about announcements, milestones, and deadlines related to different working groups.
- WHATWG1 does not publish public notifications for participation, but the public can become involved by monitoring work streams on Github. The Workstream Editor publishes notes in the repository without additional notifications. There is no specific comment period for standards, but work on living standards is ongoing. Public feedback is gathering through weekly "Triage" meetings and a Matrix chatroom. Most work is done publicly in the WHATWG Github repositories.

## Theme 6: Committee review of feedback and publication of final standard

### Description

The technical committee addresses the public’s feedback by deliberating the feedback and revising the draft standard as needed. Once a final draft is achieved and approved by the SDO, the SDO works to publish/distribute it to the standard’s intended audience.

### Research questions

- How are comments handled? 
- How are standards published? What formats?
- Are drafts publicly accessible?

### Summary

- The W3C2 process involves multiple rounds of drafts for technical documents, known as "wide review," which outlines the goal, intent, request for changes, and how those changes were addressed After review, a working draft becomes a Candidate Recommendation, which is then a Proposed Recommendation and finally a W3C Recommendation. These recommendations are published under W3C standards and drafts, and can be accessed by the working group, and by the public.
- ETSI3 allows technical groups to organize their work within the Technical Working Procedures, sharing documents via DocBox and LISTSERV. Drafts are sent to the Working Group, and approval is granted by the Technical Group. For EN standards, comments are shared with the technical committee, and a Weighted National Voting procedure is performed over 90 days. If no technical comments are received, the standard is published within 10 days, including a PDF document on the ETSI web server.
- ISO4 committees address member and liaison organization comments, and standards are published in PDF, ePub, and Redline formats, or requested in paper. Final standards are behind a paywall, but public versions of Enquiry phase documents are available through NSOs.
- The WHATWG1 process involves a review of Github issues and their solutions in a Matrix chatroom. Once the issues have been addressed and their solutions have matured and met necessary requirements, such as basic browser support and implementation, the issues and solutions are merged into the living standard by the workstream editor.
- The Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC)21,22,23 is responsible for the development and publication of standards. The committee collects feedback from stakeholders, including industry representatives and the public, during a public comment period.

## Theme 7: Regular review of published standards

### Description

The standard is reviewed every few years to ensure it is still relevant and applicable to the current state of affairs.

### Research questions

- While a standard is published - is there a way for stakeholders and the general public to provide feedback on the standard in practice?
- Who is responsible for review and upkeep of a published standard? Is the technical committee retained for this purpose, or is a new group created?
- How is the public informed about standards that are being reviewed?
- Is the public involved in this process?

### Summary

- The W3C2 (W3C, 2023) emphasizes the ongoing review of published standards, which can be updated through an update request or a new working draft. New features can be added to a recommendation, but some recommendations prohibit new features from being feature-stable. Feedback is primarily collected through Github issues for different working groups, similar to Theme 5. A Working Group is responsible for maintaining a recommendation, and if there is no Working Group, the W3C Team assumes responsibility. Public notification is required for revisions, ensuring all stakeholders, including the general public, have adequate notice of the progress of the Working Group. Any changes to existing recommendations must undergo wide review before being incorporated, following the same process as Theme 5.
- WHATWG's1 workstream policy involves regular review of published standards without a discrete maintenance phase. Issues can be filed to the Workstream repository, which can be addressed by other contributors. Feedback mechanisms are similar to Theme 5. The workstream editor is responsible for reviewing and maintaining living standards. Public notification is provided by the editor, and participants are responsible for being updated on any changes.
- The WhatWG is a collaborative standard review process that involves regular review of published standards, with no discrete maintenance phase. The workstream editor is responsible for updating living standards, and participants are responsible for being up-to-date on any issues or revisions. The ETSI3 standard database indicates which standards are being revised, with details for the update indicating the Technical Body in charge of the work. Participants can sign up for alerts for a standard being revised to be notified of the next publicly available version.

- European organizations like BSI, DIN, AFNOR, and NEN conduct regular reviews of published standards every five years to ensure they remain relevant and up-to-date with technological advancements and market needs. Feedback is collected from stakeholders, including industry professionals, regulatory bodies, and the public, and the responsibility for reviewing and maintaining standards falls on the same technical committee that developed the standard. Public information on standards being reviewed is communicated through official announcements, newsletters, press releases, and social media channels. Stakeholders are typically involved in consultation phases and may hold workshops or meetings to discuss standards under review. Examples of countries with successful review processes include the United Kingdom (BSI)40, Germany (DIN)42, France (AFNOR)41, and the Netherlands (NEN)43. These organizations maintain the same technical committees for review and maintain transparency to keep the public informed about standards under review.
