## About

IDRC's Regulating the Digital Domain (RtDD) project is committed to advancing digital inclusion and ICT accessibility for people with disabilities by addressing the failure of existing regulatory processes to create inclusive and accessible digital systems. Our multidisciplinary project team is tackling six pivotal challenges and developing the groundwork for a regulatory system that will ensure the digital domain is inclusive, equitable and accessible for everyone.
