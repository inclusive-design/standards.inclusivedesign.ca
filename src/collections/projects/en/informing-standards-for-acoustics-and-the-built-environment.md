## About

IDRC partnered with Carleton Universityâ€™s Accessibility Institute on the Informing Standards for Acoustics and the Built Environment project, which has investigated the impact of the acoustic environment on people with disabilities and explored technologies that can contribute to reducing and eliminating acoustics barriers.

Informed by research literature, field assessments of available acoustics technologies and active engagement with people with lived experience of disability, the research team has recommended a set of acoustics best practices and informed the creation of accessibility standards to improve the quality and comfort of the listening experience.
