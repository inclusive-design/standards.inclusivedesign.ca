## About

The goal of Communication Access project is to inform development of communication access standards and regulations under the Accessible Canada Act. The Accessible Canada Act specifically lists communication as an area where barriers will be identified, removed and prevented. This IDRC research will address communication access for people who have speech, language and communication disabilities. In this work, we focus on communication access for people who have speech, language and communication disabilities due to life-long or acquired cognitive and/or neurological disabilities.

Our research builds on research carried out by Communication Disabilities Access Canada (CDAC) and extends and supports recommendations previously tabled by CDAC. This research will inform development of an Equitable Communication Standard.
