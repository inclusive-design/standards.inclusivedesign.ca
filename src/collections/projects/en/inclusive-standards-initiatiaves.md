## Trust Meter

IDRC is working with stakeholders to develop a new Technical Specification for Standards Council of Canada (SCC) called Trust Meter.

The Trust Meter Technical Specification will support development of an inclusive and balanced data environment, beginning with persons with disabilities and extending to other marginalized groups. The Trust Meter Technical Specification outlines the requirements for notifying AI systems operators when the scenario, group or individual about whom the AI-based decision is made, is out-of-distribution relative to the training set the model is trained on. In such cases, the AI is unreliable to make these decisions.

The Trust Meter project is being advanced under SCC’s AI and Data Governance (AIDG) Program. For more information about this project, please contact Vera Roberts ([vroberts@ocadu.ca](mailto:vroberts@ocadu.ca)).

## Equitable Communications Draft Standard

We're worked with [Canadian Association of the Deaf](https://cad-asc.ca/) and the [Canadian Communication Access Alliance](https://www.cdacanada.com/) to prepare a draft standard for Equitable Communication that may be used by an Accessibility Standards Canada technical committee to develop a full standard for public review. 

## Emergency Measures Draft Standard

We prepared a draft standard for Emergency Measures that may be used by an Accessibility Standards Canada technical committee to develop a full standard for public review. 

## Autism Framework for Standards Development

We're working with[ Autism Alliance of Canada](https://autismalliance.ca/) to develop an Autism Framework that can be use by standards development committees so that they can better consider the needs of Autistic people in their standards.
