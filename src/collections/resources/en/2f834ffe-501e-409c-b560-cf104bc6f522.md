  CAD was launched at the 2007 Internet Governance Forum in Rio to address accessibility in ICT and emerging technologies. Its mission is to ensure inclusive digital access for all, recognizing that accessibility benefits everyone—whether due to disability, environment, or aging.

  DCAD fosters dialogue on digital accessibility in global Internet governance, operating as an open, multistakeholder initiative within the IGF framework. Members follow the IGF’s Code of Conduct and contribute to shaping inclusive tech policy.
