Through a [jurisdictional scan](https://standards.inclusivedesign.ca/resources/jurisdictional-scan/) and working with disabled and Deaf co-researchers, the All Standards With Us project has compiled this list of barriers to participation in the standards development process. This list will be the foundation for the guidelines for Standards Development Organizations  that the project is producing with the goal of improving inclusion in standards development.

## Participation & Representation Barriers

- Disabled and Deaf people and other equity-denied groups are underrepresented on technical committees.
- Leadership and decision-making roles rarely reflect diverse voices.
- People who represent consumer interests or lived experiences are often tokenized and not valued as technical experts.
- Women, racialized people, Global South participants, bilingual individuals, neurodivergent people, Deaf people and disabled people face extra barriers.
- It's difficult for new members to connect to informal networks or find mentors.

## Recruitment, Onboarding & Retention Barriers

- The application and selection process is often not clear or open.
- New members rarely get proper onboarding or clear explanations of their roles.
- There’s no standard mentorship program or disability-inclusive orientation.
- Committees are slow to respond to new members’ questions, and members aren’t sure what they’re supposed to do once they have joined a committee.
- Few incentives like pay or public recognition lead to burnout and people leaving the process.

## Meeting Design & Facilitation Barriers

- Accessibility supports like captions, and assistive technology are inconsistent. There may not be a budget to support this.
- ASL and LSQ interpretation is not always available, sometimes due to budget.
- Hybrid meetings are often poorly set up, making it hard to fully participate.
- Meetings often use complex jargon, participants speak too fast, or only use English.
- Informal parts of meetings (like breaks or side chats) are often inaccessible.
- People feel stigma around asking for accommodations and there’s a common attitude that they should handle things on their own.

## Digital Tools & Document Accessibility Barriers

- Many platforms (like Canvas or Google Docs) don’t work well with assistive technologies like screen readers, or have regional access issues.
- Documents are shared too late or are not available in accessible formats (e.g., no alt text, complex PDFs). There is rarely an option for an ASL or LSQ interpretation of a document.
- Different video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Teams, WebEx) offer different levels of accessibility.
- Forms and documents like financial reports are often not accessible.
- Content is too dense and technical, with no scaffolding or plain language support.

## Outreach, Public Engagement & Feedback Barriers

- Outreach doesn’t go beyond known networks; many people don’t know that opportunities to participate in standards development processes exist.
- Guidance on feedback processes are hard to find or understand, and it’s unclear how input is used and the decisions are made.
- Feedback is often collected in hard-to-use formats (like Excel spreadsheets).
- There is no dedicated contact point or help desk for public questions about standards.

## Organizational Culture Barriers

- Accessibility is often handled informally and relies on individual champions.
- There are no clear policies or accountability systems for inclusion.
- Industry and technical experts are prioritized over civil society or lived experience.
- Committees and organizations work in silos, making it harder to coordinate inclusive efforts.

## Language & Communication Barriers

- English is often the only language used, with no translation or sign language available.
- Accessibility settings differ by platform and region.
- Participants may face challenges with digital literacy or understanding technical content.
- Registration forms often don’t ask about access needs.

## Structural & Procedural Barriers

- There’s no rule that says disabled or Deaf people must be included, or that access needs must be addressed.
- Long-standing rules and the consensus models slow progress and hide inequalities.
- Standards are expensive or hard to access, especially for individuals or smaller groups.
- Long-time members can act as gatekeepers, making it hard for newcomers to join.
- Processes are inconsistent, with unclear roles and decision-making paths.

## Training & Capacity Building Barriers

- Chairs and project leads don’t always get training on inclusion or accessibility.
- There are no leadership programs or fellowships to support disabled or Deaf people in these spaces.
- Orientation materials rarely cover disability, use plain language, or are available in sign languages.
- Participants have to learn to advocate for themselves without much support.
- Many people don’t know how standards affect their lives, making it harder to get involved.

## Trust & Power Barriers

- People are sometimes seen as “difficult” if they raise issues or ask for access.
- Power is held by chairs or boards that don’t reflect marginalized communities.
- New members often don’t know when or how to contribute.
- There’s a lack of transparency in how decisions are made or how drafts are shared.

## Funding & Resource Barriers

- Most participants are not paid, and many can’t afford to stay involved.
- Travel, prep time, and accessibility costs are often not covered.
- Funding usually goes to organizations, not individuals, which limits grassroots involvement.
- There’s little or no funding for informal needs like accessibility supports for networking or side conversations.
- Complex travel and visa processes limit the participation of disabled and Deaf delegates especially from the Global South.
