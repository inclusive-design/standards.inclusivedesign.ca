## Building Standards for Everyone, with Everyone

The Guidelines for Accessibility and Inclusion in Standards Development is a practical resource to help Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) create more welcoming, equitable, and accessible processes especially for people with disabilities and Deaf people. It identifies common participation barriers and offers actionable strategies based on lived experience, inclusive design, and real-world examples.

Flexible and adaptable to diverse contexts, the guidelines serve as a reflective and practical tool to pinpoint improvements, spark dialogue, and guide change.

## Who are the Guidelines for?

- Project managers and staff who coordinate technical committees;
- Committee chairs and facilitators;
- Membership and recruitment teams;
- Accessibility and inclusion staff;
- Editorial and publication teams;
- Anyone involved in shaping how standards are developed and who gets to participate.

## How were these Guidelines created?

This guideline is grounded in both research and lived experience. It was started in June 2024 and continues to evolve through:

- Feedback from current and former members of technical committees and SDOs, particularly those with lived experiences of disability;
- Insights from related projects at the Inclusive Design Research Centre, including [Review of the Review](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/projects/rotr/);
- Application of inclusive design principles and practices developed at the IDRC;
- Findings from a [jurisdictional scan](https://standards.inclusivedesign.ca/resources/jurisdictional-scan/) of SDO processes internationally;
- Co-design sessions with members of the disability and Deaf community.

## How to use the Guidelines

The guidelines are organized into five core themes, each representing a key stage or area within the standards development process.

Each theme highlights common challenges as well as opportunities to improve accessibility and inclusion.

You can use the guidelines in the following two ways:

**Explore by Stages**

Browse by Stages and select a topic that interests you. For each topic, you’ll find practical solutions to make the standards development process more inclusive, along with the specific challenges these solutions can help address.

**Explore by Opportunities for Improvement**

Visit the challenges library to see a list of barriers faced by SDOs, organized by the five core themes and their topics. From there, you can select a specific challenge and explore the approaches and strategies that can help resolve it.
