The Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC) has been engaged in the development of standards and guidelines for over thirty years beginning with participation in the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Weâ€™ve participated in the development of accessibility standards for regulations like the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and have helped to develop other international accessibility standards and guidelines through organizations like ISO and IMS Global. More recently, our work has focussed on accessibility standards in Canada and Europe with much of our efforts supporting standards for the Accessible Canada Act.
