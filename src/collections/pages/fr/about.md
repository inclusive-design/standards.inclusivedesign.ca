## **How Do We Make Standards Accessible?**

At Inclusive Standards, we ensure that standards are accessible in both content and process. Our approach focuses on breaking down barriers and fostering inclusivity through the following strategies:

### Accessible Formats

We provide standards in multiple formats, including:

- Plain language versions
- Braille and large print
- Audio recordings
- Sign language translations
- Accessible digital files compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies

### Inclusive Engagement

We actively involve diverse stakeholders, including people with disabilities, marginalized groups, and individuals with lived experience, ensuring their voices shape the standards.

### User-Centered Design

Standards are reviewed and tested to ensure they meet the practical needs of all users, particularly those with disabilities or other accessibility requirements.

### Training and Awareness

We provide training sessions and resources to help stakeholders understand and apply accessible standards, fostering widespread adoption.

### Continuous Feedback

Through public reviews, surveys, and consultations, we invite feedback to refine standards, ensuring they remain inclusive and relevant over time.

## What do we do?

At Inclusive Standards, we go beyond developing inclusive guidelines. We work to transform the entire process of standards creation by:

### Advocating for Equity

Embedding equity, diversity, and inclusion at every stage of the standards development process.

### Simplifying Access

Breaking down technical language and creating resources that are easy to understand for non-technical audiences.

### Collaborating Globally

Partnering with organizations and communities worldwide to promote inclusive practices and share best methods.

### Leading by Example

By modeling inclusive practices in our own work, we demonstrate how accessibility can and should be integrated into every aspect of standards development.

Through these efforts, we aim to set a benchmark for accessible and inclusive standards development.
